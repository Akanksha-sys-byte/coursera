<b>It's always important to put readme files on any github project.</b>
You should put a brief descrition of what this repository is/was used for.
In the future, when you stumble upon this repsitory, the README will help refresh your memeory.
This is what a readme file looks like.
<ol>
  <li>When creating a README file remember to add the ".md" as the file type.</li>
  <li>.md files use a language called markdown; which allows you to use inline HTML or just type plain text.</li>

  <li>It is also important to use the readme file by updating it with path decisions and important "about" information.</li>
