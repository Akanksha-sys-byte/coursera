**It's always important to put readme files on any github project.**
You should put a brief descrition of what this repository is/was used for.
In the future, when you stumble upon this repsitory, the README will help refresh your memeory.

1. When creating a README file remember to add the ".md" as the file type.
2. .md files use a language called markdown; which allows you to use inline HTML or just type plain text.
3. Here's the link to markdown sytanx https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
4. It is also important to use the README file by updating it with path decisions and important "about" information.
